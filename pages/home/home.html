      <ul>
        <li>A backend, with at least one endpoint that supports pagination.

        <li>
          A frontend with at least one page, that uses the endpoint created above
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>I have several endpoints that support pagination in my backend. I only use one of them in my frontend but with that I also sort the table created. 
        In the navbar are also links to some unfinished bootstrap exercises I have been playing with that you should disregard.
        I didn't manage to make the filter function work for pagination, only the sorting.
